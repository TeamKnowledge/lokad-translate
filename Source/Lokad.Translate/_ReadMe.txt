Lokad.Translate

A web-based utility tool, to speed-up the translation process.

TODO for v1.0:
- upgrade lib using Lokad.Data.dll

(caution: NHibernate config need a fix as well)

- repository implementations need review (newbie at NHibernate)

POSTPONED

- multi-tenancy + admin setup (needed to create the first user)
==> Caution: in case of multi-tenant, a single translator may belong to multiple account!

- performance is awful (=> don't care for prototype)
- improve dates display
- upgrade NHibernate toward the Linq interface (much cleaner and compact)

- upgrade to ASP.NET MVC v2 when it becomes available.
