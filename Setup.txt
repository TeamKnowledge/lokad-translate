(*) To setup a database in SQL Azure, follow these steps (you will not be able to use the GUI-based commands):
1. Make sure that your SQL Azure account is active (go to http://sql.azure.com)
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio (Express), and:
	a) dismiss the default connection dialog, open a new query window and
	   logon using your administrator credentials (see admin console mentioned above)
	b) create a database with:
	   create database [YourDatabase]
	c) create a login with:
	   create login [your_login] with password = 'your_password'
	d) disconnect and re-connect specifying [YourDatabase] in the connection options, using the same admin login used before
	e) map a user to the new login and assign it the appropriate schema with:
	   create user [your_login] for login [your_login] -- using the same login name for simplicity
	   exec sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'your_login'
	f) disconnect and re-connect specifying [YourDatabase] in the connection options, using the same NEW login
	g) run the DDL script (authenticating as 'your_login')

(**) Use the following format:
     Server=tcp:YOUR_HOST.database.windows.net;Database=YourDatabase;User ID=your_login;Password=your_password;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;
